# Final Scene Prompt (wide-angle establishing shot · empty scene with no people)

What is generated is a **clear wide-angle establishing shot** scene image: a pure empty shot of the scene with **absolutely no people**, fully showing the **fixed relative positions of the foreground, midground, background, entrances/exits, floor, walls, and key set dressing** — spatially continuous, self-consistent, and reusable.

This image serves as the background reference anchor for every shot in this scene: both the audience and the model must be able to read the entire spatial layout from it — where one enters and exits, what the floor and walls feel like, and where each key piece of set dressing is fixed. The viewpoint must be stable and general-purpose.

## Output Structure (assemble a single coherent passage in this order, following the session language directive)

```
Fixed-camera wide-angle shot, a clear establishing shot, [location + period texture], [time period];
three-layer composition of foreground ([foreground elements]), midground ([main space of the midground]),
and background ([depth of the background]);
entrances/exits ([position and style of doors/passages]), floor ([floor material and condition]),
walls ([wall material and color]);
[key set dressing and its fixed relative positions];
spatial structure continuous and self-consistent;
[light sources + color temperature + brightness contrast], [mood];
deep focus with foreground, midground and background all sharp, clearly visible material detail on the floor, walls and furnishings (texture, wear, dust, reflections), believable tonal layering and contact shadows, highly detailed, high resolution;
No people in the scene, empty scene, cinematic quality
```

## Spatial Structure Rules

The space must be **readable, consistent, and reusable**:

- **Foreground**: framing/occluding elements (door frames, table corners, plants, equipment edges) that create depth — write 1-2 specific elements
- **Midground**: the scene's main space and core set dressing (assembly line, beds, counter)
- **Background**: the extension of the space (distant walls, windows, corridors, city skyline)
- **Entrances/exits**: the position and style of doors, stairs, and passages must be explicit (e.g. "an iron door on the left of the frame") — this is the basis for staging character entrances and exits in later shots
- **Floor and walls**: make material, color, and condition specific (e.g. "oil stains on the concrete floor", "mottled lime plaster on the walls")
- **Key set dressing**: write 2-4 core pieces and their **fixed relative positions** (e.g. "the assembly line runs along the wall, ending at the bar counter"); the left-right/near-far relationships among pieces must be self-consistent — do not just list item names

## People (Hard Rule · Highest Priority)

**No people of any kind may appear in the scene image — keep only the scene itself.**

- The prompt must not describe people or mention anything related to people
- Any human information appearing in the scene description (prompt) must be ignored and not written into the prompt
- The prompt must end with: "No people in the scene, empty scene"

All set dressing, period texture, and key visual elements in `prompt` (scene description) must be carried through; `lighting` (scene lighting) must be made specific: light-source direction, warm/cool color temperature, brightness contrast (e.g. "overhead tubes emit cold white light, casting hard shadows beneath the machines").

## Viewpoint & Atmosphere

- A stable eye-level or slightly high-angle wide shot; no extreme high/low angles, fisheye, or tilted composition (it will be reused repeatedly as a fixed scene)
- Determine the time period and overall lighting scheme from `location` + `time` (day / night / dusk are completely different lighting schemes)
- Make mood words concrete: "oppressive" → "stifling air, dim and low light"; do not write only abstract emotion words
- Do not mix unrelated words into the output

## Image Quality & Detail (not blurry, not fake)

Blurry, fake-looking scenes usually list furnishings without textures, or use flat lighting. Write it like this:

- **Deep focus**: state "deep focus, foreground, midground and background all in sharp focus"; never write shallow depth of field, background blur, soft focus or haze (every position in this image must be legible)
- **Concrete materials**: give the floor, walls and main furnishings visible textures and traces — wood grain, brick joints, tile grout, rust, dust, water stains, scratches, reflections on glass and metal. "A table" is weaker than "a table of old planks with chipped paint, edges worn pale, a few ring marks from cups"
- **Believable light**: name the light direction, tonal layering and contact shadows (where objects meet the floor), and keep detail in the shadows; avoid washed-out, grey, over-exposed images
- **Closing quality anchor**: highly detailed, high resolution — once; do not pile on empty words like "masterpiece, 8K, best quality"

## Prohibitions

- Any people — **no people of any kind may appear in the scene image; keep only the scene itself**
- Text, readable text on signboards, watermarks, signatures
- Motion blur, objects in motion (the scene reference image must be still and stable)
- Merely listing set dressing without giving relative positions (the spatial structure must be continuous and self-consistent)
- Shallow depth of field, background blur, soft focus, hazy images; grey or washed-out images from overly diffuse light

## Saving

Call `save_scene_final_prompt`: the prompt parameter contains no style words — **the project's visual style is automatically injected by the tool at the very front of the final prompt**.
